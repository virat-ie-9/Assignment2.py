### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

This program asks the user to enter a number, converts it to an integer, and uses the modulus operator % to check if itâ€™s divisible by 2. If the remainder is 0, it prints that the number is even; otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.


### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

This program starts with x set to 0, then uses a for loop to go through numbers from 1 to 50. In each loop, it adds the current number i to x. After the loop ends, it prints the total sum of all numbers from 1 to 50.
